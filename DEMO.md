# Demo Video
This demo presents a 3–5 minute end-to-end walkthrough of an event-sourced agentic intake system designed for enterprise and public-sector workflows.

What the Demo Covers

    The problem: Traditional intake systems lose context, overwrite updates, and lack auditability.

    The solution: An agentic system that treats each request as an event stream, enabling safe follow-ups, full audit trails, and deterministic behavior.

Agentic behavior:

Planning the request type and required fields

Using tools (Gemini) selectively for language understanding

Persisting memory as append-only events

Reconstructing case state via event replay
